# Timezones for AngularJS [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/michaelahlers/angular-timezones.png)](http://travis-ci.org/michaelahlers/angular-timezones)

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.com/) features for [TimezoneJS](https://github.com/mde/timezone-js)-enhanced JavaScript `Date` objects.

## Inclusion

### Bower

[Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) users can add the following to their package dependencies. Be sure to see [_tags_](https://github.com/michaelahlers/angular-timezones/tags) for a list of available versions.

```json
{
  "dependencies" : {
    "angular-timezones" : "git@github.com:michaelahlers/angular-timezones.git#0.3.0"
  }
}
```

## Usage

After including `angular-timezones.js`, add this package to your application.

```javascript
angular.module('your-application', ['Timezones'])
```

### Resolution

The `$timezones.resolve(timezone, reference)` function will, using the reference `Date` provided, look up complete details about the timezone&mdash;including the abbreviation, offset, and decomposed region and locality. This is useful for avoiding clever tricks to extract abbreviations from `Date.toString` (which is not particularly portable or robust). Additionally, resulting values are derived from the authoritative IANA timezone data.

### Detection

If [jsTimezoneDetect](https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetect) is included, the `$timezones.getLocal()` function will detect the browser's local timezone and provide a complete definition that's resolved against the IANA database.

## Examples

See `docs/examples` for demonstrations of these features. As timezone data (found in `tz/data`) _must_ be served from a web server, these examples will not work from the local disk. However, there is a quick solution for most platforms: the files can be served with Python's [`SimpleHTTPServer`](http://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html).

```shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Once running, visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser, and navigate to the examples folder.

## Developers

_Timezones for Angular_ is tested with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) against the latest available release of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (2.0.0) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.com/) (1.1.4).

With [NPM](http://npmjs.com/) installed, you can test your modifications with the following.

```
npm install
npm test
```
